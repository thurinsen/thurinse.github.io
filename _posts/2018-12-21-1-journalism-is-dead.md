In the wake of recent revelations regarding Der Spiegel's top journalist Claas Relotius' fabrications, I was genuinely shocked and didn't understand the world anymore. The scale of these news still eludes me. It's gravity and significance have send ripples throug journalism space-time.

#### What happened?

On Wednesday Der Spiegel revealed that Relotius faked, fabricated and invented at least 14 of his 60 articles he wrote since 2011, including his most prized and award-winning stories, for example 'The Last Witness', 'Lionchildren' and 'Number 440'. For years Relotius' lies went undetected, even by the factcheckers employed by the magazine. The hero of this story, Juan Moreno, dicovered the fabrications when working together with Relotius on an article about a citizen militia on US-Mexikan border. He spent his own free time on investigating minor errors in Relotius' article and brought them forth day for day, until Relotius' intricate cardhouse finally collapsed.

#### My Thoughts:

This is of course a comically bad time for this to happen. In the time of fake news and mistrust of conventional journalism, this is exactly wht we don't need: Somebody actually faking stories. I know that the world will recuperate from this, but still.
