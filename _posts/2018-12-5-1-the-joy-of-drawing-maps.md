title: The Joy of Drawing Maps
---

I absolutly love drawing maps. One of the reasons is, that they help me visit different places. When I draw a map, like Skjegholm, I am immediately immersed into this piece of world I am creating. As I draw I find myself thinking about the different cultures and stories its inhabitants might tell and how an average day would look like there.

For example, Skjegholm, a nordic, islandic inspired island in my world is a rough place to live. The constant cold and unfriendly surroundings makes it hard for its inhabitants, but they stay strong. Old legends kept them here, and they have started to best even the roughest parts of nature.
