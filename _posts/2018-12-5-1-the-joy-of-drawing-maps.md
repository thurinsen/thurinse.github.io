title: The Joy of Drawing Maps
---

I absolutly love drawing maps. One of the reasons is, that they help me visit different places. When I draw a map, like Skjegholm, I am immediately immersed into this piece of world I am creating. As I draw I find myself thinking about the different cultures and stories its inhabitants might tell and how an average day would look like there.

For example, Skjegholm, a nordic, islandic inspired island in my world is a rough place to live. The constant cold and unfriendly surroundings makes it hard for its inhabitants, but they stay strong. Old legends kept them here, and they have started to best even the roughest parts of nature.

### The History of Skjegholm

When the island was settled 1200 years ago, there were white dragons roaming and battling the local frost giants. In this turmoil, the city of Skjeg was settled as a trading post between what is now northern Unias and the western reaches of Durkazur, a now lost dwarven kingdom. Eventually the dragons emerged victorious and made the last giants ther slaves. Under the great white dragon Paranor Icefall they would have started to destroy human setlements, but the king of Skjeg, Sturlur, stood up and amassed a group of 50 heroes, who took up the battle and started iradicating the dragons. When only Paranor Icefall was left, Sturlur and his eight most trustworthy and strongest companions faced him on the plains of Skihar, where they have slain him. And so began the age of man on Skjegholm. Slowly but surely they managed to settle even the most remote parts of the island.

### The Culture of Skjegholm

Since Skjegholm suffers from the arctic day and night more than many other settlements, their entire culture is centered around light and familial bonds. In the long arctic night, bards and great fires hold up the spirits until the light of day returns again. Old tales and legends are recited and mythical songs of great heroes are sung. This is how they keep the memory of their past alive.
