German has an interesting problem: There is no gnederneutral pronoun, similar to the english 'they' that isn't degrading or objectifying. I often wondered what would change if it had one.

Enter 'xier', a newly proposed genderneutral pronoun to be used in everyday conversations. I just find it sad, that it is quite unwieldy to say and read. Language is something very reliant on habit, so a new word like 'xier' seems out of place and uncomfortable to use. This is also the case because it is a sound that doesn't really match the melody of the german language. It is to 'pointy', for the lack of a better description.

So how do we solve this problem? There needs to be a solution because otherwise this word won't find a lot of use. Another word that better fits the actual spoken language might do the trick. In english it is a word that already existed beforhand. So what word could we use that already exists? Well, the pronoun to describe plural is unfortunatly 'sie', which is also the female singular pronoun, so that won't be of use. The agender pronoun 'es' is more seen as an insult rather than of actual use. So the search continues....
