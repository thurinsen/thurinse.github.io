title: Fallingwater by Frank Lloyd Wright
---

I love architecture. I am a big fan for aesthically pleasing buildings and urban engineering. One of my all time favourite buildings of all
for me will always be Fallingwater by famous US architect Frank Lloyd Wright.

This building is more than just a nice looking weekend home now museum - it is a work of art. The way it incorporates its namesake, a waterfall from the small stream it is built upon, is a communion of man-made structures and natures beauty. Sadly, Fallingwater has some problems associated with its unique position: The ongoing dampness of the river has resulted in a problem with mold. The Kaufmann family used it as a weekend residence until the 1960's, when Edgar Kaufmann Jr. gifted it to a preservaation society, who turned the now US landmark into an attraction for the interested, attracting over 160,000 visitors each year.

### A Dynamic House

It was one of Frank Lloyd Wright's themes, continuing through most of his work that the buildings he designed should live in harmony with its surroundings. By working WITH the nature and not against it he achieved this astounding beauty that is Fallingwater.
