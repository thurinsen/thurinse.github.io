I used to walk the paths leading up to Worfield Castle every day.

From the first step out of my door, through the village along the river out into the fields, greeting Margaret Welton and her flowers, through the forest to the old guardhouse. From there I would take the winding path up the hill to the castle, where I would rest and breath, before returning to the village along the river.

I hadn’t made the journey for some weeks now; my legs couldn’t carry me any longer. Age has gotten the better of me.

The days in bed are the worst. It has gotten better, however. The first time I could not stand up, I panicked, feeling utterly stripped and powerless. I learned to deal with it, to accept it, and what to do in bed. 

My situation got better, and there were days I would spend in the garden. The beautiful late autumn sun would shine, and I would be happy.

On the 17th of November, an unusually warm day, I decided to take on the path again. I had felt even better the days before and was sure of my strength.

With a small staff at my side I went from the first step out of my door, along the alley. I was amazed at seeing the flowers along the way, sprouting out of the sides of gardens.

The town square had a few trees, with leftover ripe fruit, glowing red and sweet. I picked it and sat at the well for a short time greeting the familiar faces.

From there the way took me into the meadows, the river trickling besides me. Its water was fresh and cool, and taking a sip of it invigorated me.

Then I came upon the flower-gardens of Margaret Welton. She worked there, digging around, cutting weeds. Her warm smile greeted me.
The forest was not as warm, but still comfortable. The winding paths up the hill I took with surprising ease, they had proven a challenge the last time I took the path.

On the hilltop, beneath the stony ruins of the castle, I stopped, looking, gazing around the land. I was born here and spent my life here. I never grew tired and I never left. On the top, I reminisced on my life, the house I was born, the old school, when I worked the fields, my wedding, the joy of children, retirement, the quiet cottage, my walks. 
A life lived to the fullest.

When I returned to the cottage in the afternoon sun, I heard voices. The clear voices of my grandchildren, their parents, my close friends. I knew it was a beautiful day in the evening sun. 

Every day going forth would be as beautiful as this one. Every day I took my walks to Worfield Castle, through the village along the river out into the fields, greeting Margaret Welton and her flowers, through the forest to the old guardhouse. From there I would take the winding path up the hill to the castle, where I would rest and breath, before returning to the village along the river, where I would be greeted by the ones that loved me. I never grew tired.

William Strowings died in sleep on the passing night of the 16th of November.
