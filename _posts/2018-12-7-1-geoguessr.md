title: Not a Game, a Platform
---

I recently picked up Geoguessr again, a browser game that puts you into a random spot of Google Street View and you have to figure out where you are. You click yourself through five landscapes, cities and streets, and can get up to 5000 points per round.

### Geoguessr, a Game?

Geoguessr was advertisied as a game, created by swedish IT-advisor Anton Wallen. Not only can you play on the world map, but eager users can also create their own maps, for example US Cities or European Stadiums.

### Geoguessr, a Platform?

Much more interesting for me is what you can do with Geoguessr: Its unique concept and execution is perfect to grow your own ideas. I will now explain some of mine:

###### Standard Competition

Five starting points will be prepared beforhand. Then, everybody who wants to play can start a timer and start guessing. After they are done playing, their time and points will get evaluated. The one with the smallest time needed will get their points multiplied by one, the slowest with 0.5. Everyone in between will be linearly scaled to these points.

###### Speedguessr

For every of the five locations the guesser has a minute for the location and has to make their guess then. The one with the most points wins.

These are just two possible ways to play with geoguessr, and I am sure there are much more!
